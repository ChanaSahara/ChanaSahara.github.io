        <h1>Travel To The UP!</h1>

        <h2>What is the UP?</h2>
        <p>Michigan is a state in the US, commonly known as "the mitten state", because it is shaped, surprisingly, like a mitten.<br>
        So, <em>what's the UP?</em> UP stands for <strong>Upper Peninsula</strong>.<br> That's right! Michigan is unique because <em>it has two peninsulas.</em><br>
            In this trip guide we will be focusing on the <strong>UP</strong> (upper peninsula). Read on for more information!</p>
    <h2>Why should I travel to the UP?</h2>
    <p>The UP is a truly lovely place. Michigan is known for it's great lakes, being the Great Lake State. The UP is surrounded by three of the great lakes;<br>
        Lake Superior, Lake Huron, and of course Lake Michigan. There are many campgrounds to stay in if you want more of a rustic experience,<br>
        or if you perfer sleeping indoors there are also hotels.</p>
    <p>One thing that stands out about the UP is the population. Although certain places attract many tourists, the population is small<br>
        compared to the lower peninsula. This makes it a wonderful place to travel...you can make your vacation calm and relaxing,<br>
        or if you choose, you can also mingle with crowds at sight-seeing spots.</p>
    <p>Following are some pictures, so you know just what you're getting when <strong>you</strong> book your flight.</p>

    <p class="sand-dune-info">A sand dune is a hill or mountain of sand, formed by the waves of the great lakes washing up sand, and <br>
        the wind blowing in into great mountain like structures. Although the UP isn't known for it's dunes, (as the lower peninsula is, being home<br>
        to the famous <em>Sleeping Bear Dunes<em>), there are still many impressive dunes. One is the <strong>Log Slide Overlook<strong>, which<br>
        is exactl what ist sounds like. Sand dunes can be great "play grounds" for kids, as well as a good, long hike.</p>

    <p class="sunset-info">Another special thing about the UP is the sunsets. Some spots are better then others, but no matter where you're staying<br>
        you can most likely find a spot close by with a beautiful view. This is partly due to much less light polution, as well as <br>
        not as many tall buildings blocking the view.</p>
    <img src="https://www.kasandbox.org/programming-images/landscapes/beach.png" width="580" height="200" alt="small beach with trees">
    <p class="beach-info">And, of course, the beaches. The UP is full of beaches, and they very a lot. <br>
        There are many large, standard beaches that attract crowds, but there are also small, more private ones like this.<br>
        You can see there's not much sand, but there is a nice slope so the water doesn't get too deep all at once like it often will. <br>
        There's also planty of shade, which large beaches don't often offer. The nice thing about the UP is that you can choose what <br>
        environment you want...large and bursting with people to meet, or small and private to enjoy yourselves.
